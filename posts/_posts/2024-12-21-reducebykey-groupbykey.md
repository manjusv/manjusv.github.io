## What are `reduceByKey()` and `groupByKey()` in Spark?
`reduceByKey()`
- **Definition**: Combines values of the same key using a specified **reduce function** (like sum, max, etc.), reducing the data **during the shuffle phase**.

- **Key Point**: Performs **aggregation (reduction)** and minimizes data sent across the network.

**Example**:
```python
# Create an RDD of key-value pairs
rdd = spark.sparkContext.parallelize([("a", 1), ("b", 2), ("a", 3), ("b", 4)])

# Apply reduceByKey to sum values by key
result = rdd.reduceByKey(lambda x, y: x + y).collect()

print(result)  # Output: [('a', 4), ('b', 6)]
```

`groupByKey()`
- **Definition**: Groups all values with the same key **into a list**. Does not perform any reduction.

- **Key Point**: Shuffles all the data to group keys without reducing it, which can result in higher memory usage.

**Example**:
```python
# Apply groupByKey to group values by key
result = rdd.groupByKey().mapValues(list).collect()

print(result)  # Output: [('a', [1, 3]), ('b', [2, 4])]
```

## Layman Explanation
Imagine you are sorting fruit baskets:

1. `reduceByKey()`:
You **count the fruits** in each basket and only move the total count, making the process faster.

    *Example*: Combine all apples locally and send "Apples: 10."

2. `groupByKey()`:
You **move every single fruit** to its respective basket, even if it’s the same type.

    *Example*: Move each apple to the "Apple Basket," then count them later.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

        <tr>
            <td>Reduces data during shuffling</td>

        <tr>
            <td>Faster and memory-efficient</td>			
            <td>Requires a reduce function</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Uses combiners for optimization</td>			
            <td>Not suitable when raw data grouping is needed</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>

            <td>Higher memory and network overhead</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Suitable when you need grouped values</td>			
            <td>Risk of out-of-memory errors with large data</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>No need to define a reduce function</td>			
            <td>Inefficient compared to reduceByKey for aggregation</td>

## When to Use reduceByKey() vs groupByKey()
**Use** `reduceByKey()`:
- When you need **aggregation** (e.g., sum, max, min).

- If you want **better performance** and **lower memory usage**.

**Use** `groupByKey()`:
- When you need the **raw grouped values** (e.g., a list of all values for each key).

- If you’re applying custom logic after grouping, which cannot be reduced during the shuffle.

## Key Takeaways
- **Efficiency**: `reduceByKey()` is more efficient as it reduces data before shuffling.

- **Memory Usage**: `groupByKey()` can use more memory and is slower for large datasets.

- **Use Case**:
    - Use `reduceByKey()` for aggregation tasks like summing or counting.

    - Use `groupByKey()` for retrieving raw data grouped by keys.


## `reduceByKey()` Real-World Use Cases
1. **Log Analysis - Count Requests per Status Code**
    - Imagine analyzing web server logs to count how many requests returned status codes like `200`, `404`, `500`.

    ```python
    logs = [("200", 1), ("404", 1), ("200", 1), ("500", 1), ("404", 1)]
    rdd = spark.sparkContext.parallelize(logs)

    # Count occurrences of each status code
    status_counts = rdd.reduceByKey(lambda x, y: x + y).collect()

    print(status_counts)  # Output: [('200', 2), ('404', 2), ('500', 1)]
    ```

2. **Sales Aggregation - Total Sales by Region**
    - Suppose you have sales data, and you want to calculate total sales per region.

    ```python
    sales = [("North", 100), ("South", 200), ("North", 300), ("East", 150)]
    rdd = spark.sparkContext.parallelize(sales)

    # Sum sales by region
    total_sales = rdd.reduceByKey(lambda x, y: x + y).collect()

    print(total_sales)  # Output: [('North', 400), ('South', 200), ('East', 150)]
    ```

3. **Word Count - Common Data Processing Task**
    - This is a classic Spark example for counting the occurrences of each word in a text file.

    ```python
    text = ["hello world", "hello spark", "world of spark"]
    rdd = spark.sparkContext.parallelize(text)

    # Flatten words and count
    word_counts = rdd.flatMap(lambda line: line.split(" ")) \
                    .map(lambda word: (word, 1)) \
                    .reduceByKey(lambda x, y: x + y) \
                    .collect()

    print(word_counts)  # Output: [('hello', 2), ('world', 2), ('spark', 2), ('of', 1)]
    ```

## `groupByKey()` Real-World Use Cases
1. **Group Transactions by Customer**
    - Suppose you have transaction data and want to see all transactions made by each customer.

    ```python
    transactions = [("cust1", 100), ("cust2", 200), ("cust1", 300), ("cust2", 400)]
    rdd = spark.sparkContext.parallelize(transactions)

    # Group transactions by customer
    grouped_transactions = rdd.groupByKey().mapValues(list).collect()

    print(grouped_transactions)  # Output: [('cust1', [100, 300]), ('cust2', [200, 400])]
    ```

2. **Organize Student Scores by Subject**
    - If you have student scores and want to group all scores for each subject.

    ```python
    scores = [("math", 85), ("science", 90), ("math", 78), ("science", 88)]
    rdd = spark.sparkContext.parallelize(scores)

    # Group scores by subject
    grouped_scores = rdd.groupByKey().mapValues(list).collect()

    print(grouped_scores)  # Output: [('math', [85, 78]), ('science', [90, 88])]
    ```

3. **Analyze Reviews by Product**
    - You have customer reviews for products, and you want to group reviews by each product.

    ```python
    reviews = [("product1", "Great!"), ("product2", "Good"), ("product1", "Excellent"), ("product2", "Average")]
    rdd = spark.sparkContext.parallelize(reviews)

    # Group reviews by product
    grouped_reviews = rdd.groupByKey().mapValues(list).collect()

    print(grouped_reviews)
    # Output: [('product1', ['Great!', 'Excellent']), ('product2', ['Good', 'Average'])]
    ```
